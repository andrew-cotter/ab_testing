# ab_testing
An example of an A/B test analysis in R using an example data set sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chebotinaa/fast-food-marketing-campaign-ab-test).

I made an effort to demonstrate a few key competencies in this exercise, including:

- Programming in R
- Analysis of A/B Tests
- Principles of Causal Inference
- Familiarity with fixed and mixed effect models
- Data Visualization

[ab_testing_example.md](https://github.com/andrew-cotter/ab_testing/blob/main/ab_testing_example.md) contains the analysis.
